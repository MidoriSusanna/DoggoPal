<h1>DoggoPal - Your Virtual Best Friend</h1>
<p>"DoggoPal: Your Virtual Best Friend" is an application inspired by the timeless Japanese Tamagotchi and the more sophisticated Nintendogs. DoggoPal offers users the joy of caring for their very own virtual pet, complete with simple yet engaging activities like playtime, bath time, and mealtime.<br>
Simplicity is an essential feature of DoggoPal, making it accessible to a wide range of
users, including the youngest children. This game's target audience is not
specific, catering to all age groups and even welcoming the youngest of players.</p><br>

<h1>Project Goals</h1>
<p>
-	Create a simple and intuitive application that could be also accessible to younger children. <br>
-	Create a friendly and relaxed atmosphere through an interface that visually expresses the presence of a virtual pet using backgrounds and emojis.<br>
-	Make the user able to choose name, breed, and age of the virtual dog through open questions which cannot have a blank answer.<br>
-	Create a straightforward interface where users can select actions for their virtual dog through numerical choices.<br>
-	Changing the dog's state (excitement, hunger, cleanliness) with the passage of time.<br>
-	Make the user able to teach the dog new words and commands.<br>
-	Create a dynamic in which the user must respond to the dog's inputs/statements to change its state.<br>
-	Have the possibility to exit or restart the game with another pet. <br>
-	Display the instructions in a slow manner (typing) to create a narrative effect.<br>
-	Keep the instructions and commands to access the game as simple and clear as possible.<br></p>

<h1>User Stories</h1>

<h1>Design</h1>
<p>The project relies on a pre-built terminal, limiting the design aspect.<br> Nonetheless, I aimed to enhance user engagement with a welcoming background featuring cute puppies. The central placement of the terminal adds visual balance to the page. 
To create a more welcoming atmosphere and remember the Japanese origins of this game genre (like the Tamagotchi and Nintendogs), Japanese emojis were incorporated into the text displayed in the terminal.<br></p>
