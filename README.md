<h1>DoggoPal - Your Virtual Best Friend</h1>
<p>"DoggoPal: Your Virtual Best Friend" is an application inspired by the timeless Japanese Tamagotchi and the more sophisticated Nintendogs. DoggoPal offers users the joy of caring for their very own virtual pet, complete with simple yet engaging activities like playtime, bath time, and mealtime.<br>
Simplicity is an essential feature of DoggoPal, making it accessible to a wide range of
users, including the youngest children. This game's target audience is not
specific, catering to all age groups and even welcoming the youngest of players.</p><br>

<h1>Project Goals</h1>
<p>
-	Create a simple and intuitive application that could be also accessible to younger children. <br>
-	Create a friendly and relaxed atmosphere through an interface that visually expresses the presence of a virtual pet using backgrounds and emojis.<br>
-	Make the user able to choose name, breed, and age of the virtual dog through open questions which cannot have a blank answer.<br>
-	Create a straightforward interface where users can select actions for their virtual dog through numerical choices.<br>
-	Changing the dog's state (excitement, hunger, cleanliness) with the passage of time.<br>
-	Make the user able to teach the dog new words and commands.<br>
-	Create a dynamic in which the user must respond to the dog's inputs/statements to change its state.<br>
-	Have the possibility to exit or restart the game with another pet. <br>
-	Display the instructions in a slow manner (typing) to create a narrative effect.<br>
-	Keep the instructions and commands to access the game as simple and clear as possible.<br></p>

<h1>User Stories</h1>
- As a user I can personalize the virtual pet with name, breed and age group, so that I can have a customised game experience. <br>
- As a user I can access a simple menu of actions (defined by numbers), so that I can simply navigate the game and choose the game development. <br>
- As a user I need to understand the pet feedback, so that I can respond with an appropriate action. <br>
- As a user, I want to be able to feed, play and clean the dog. <br>
- As a user, I want to be able to teach my dog a word or a command. <br>
- As a user, I want to be able to go for a walk with the pet dog. <br>
- As a user, I want to be able to exit or restart the game whenever I wish. <br>


<h1>Design</h1>
<p>The project relies on a pre-built terminal, limiting the design aspect.<br> Nonetheless, I aimed to enhance user engagement with a welcoming background featuring cute puppies. The central placement of the terminal adds visual balance to the page. 
To create a more welcoming atmosphere and remember the Japanese origins of this game genre (like the Tamagotchi and Nintendogs), Japanese emojis were incorporated into the text displayed in the terminal. ASCII art has also being added to create a welcoming atmosphere and remind us of retro games.<br></p>

<h1>Flowchart</h1>

<h1>Features</h1>

<h1>Technologies used</h1>
<p>Phyton: the application is entirely written in Phyton. <br>
HTML and CSS: HTML and CSS were used to style the layout of the page. <br>
Javascript: it was used by Code Institute to set up the terminal. <br>
Github: it was used to store the repository of the project (pushed from VSCode). <br>
VSCode: it was used for the coding process and to push the code to github. <br>
Heroku: it was used for deployment of the application. <br>
Git: version control through VSCode.</p><br>

<h1>Modules imported</h1>
<p>- randrange: <br>
This function is imported from the random module. <br>
It is used to generate a random integer within a specified range. In my project it is used to initialize and manipulate attributes of the Dog class (food, excitement, and bath).<br>
- choice: <br>
This function is imported from the random module. <br>
It is used to select a random element from a list. In my project it is used to make random choices (selecting a random pet type or friend name during the walk).<br>
- sleep: <br>
Imported from the time module. <br>
It introduces a delay (in seconds) in the execution of a programme. In my project it is used to create pauses in the game to give the appearance of the dog performing actions over time and to slow down the narration to give the user to follow the game easily.<br>
- sys: <br>
Sys is used to manipulate a standard output, allowing to create a typing effect by printing characters one at a time. This again is to slow down the narration to give the user to follow the game easily. <br>
- time: <br>
The entire time module was imported. <br>
It provides various time-related functions. In my project it is used in conjunction with sleep to control the typing effect.<br></p><br>

<h1>Bugs and Errors </h1>
- Background not showing when the app is deployed: <br>
<br>
I fixed this bug moving the CSS styiling inside the index.html file (between style tags) instead of having a separated stylesheet. The background pictures cannot be saved only locally, but needs to be stored online. Trying to save a picture for the backroung of the terminal in an asset folder will result in an error (file not found).<br>
<br>
- The dog learns the command after the 3rd time it is repeated, but the command was actually learnt after the 4th time: <br>
<br>
The 3rd time the command was input by the user, the function was not increasing the integer before checking the count. By fixing this issue the bug was also fixed. <br>
<br>
- The dog needs to learn a command even if the command is written in a different way (e.g. "sit" and "Sit"): <br><br>
To eliminate case sensitivity I added the .lower() method to the input. 
<br>
<br>
<p>The project follows the PEP8 style guidelines and passes the CI Phyton Linter https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com with no errors or warnings.</p><br>

<h1>Deployment</h1>
<h2>Version Control</h2>
<p>The website was created in VSCode and pushed to github to the repository "DoggoPal". <br>
- git add: preliminary step before committing new elements. <br>
- git commit -m "": commit changes to the repository.<br>
- git push: push the committed code to the GitHub repository. <br></p>
<h2>Deploy to Heroku</h2>
<p>The project was deployed to the cloud platform Heroku<br></p>
<p>Deployment steps:<br>
- In order for the project to run on Heroku, we  need Heroku to install the dependencies we used in the project. The list of dependencies will go in our requirements.txt file here. To create our list of requirements, we  use the following command in the terminal 'Pip3 freeze > requirements.txt'. In my project the requirements.txt file is empty because no dependencies were installed. This in the beginning was giving issue with the deployment (bug explained at the end of the section). Commit and push the changes to githhub.<br>
- Set up an Heroku account<br>
- On the dashboard, click "Create new app"<br>
- Name the App with a unique name ans select your region (EU/USA) and click "create app"<br>
-  It's important to get the settings section done before you deploying the code, click the settings tab on the top-left.<br>
-  Config Var section: if applicable (not the case of this project) add elements from .gitignore. To add as an additional config var: the key is PORT and the value is 8000. If you do not add this, thedeployment may fail. Click "Add".<br>
- Add buildpacks to the application: install more dependencies. Click "Add buildpack" and add Python, select that and then click “Save changes”. The second buildpack is called node.js, select that and click “Save”. Make sure the two buildpacks are in this order (phyton and then node.js).<br>
- Select Deployment method: Github <br>
- Confirm connceting with Github <br>
- Search the repository name to connect with Github (in this case "DoggoPal"). Click "Search" and "Connect".
- Enable automatic deploy: this way Heroku will rebuild the app every time a new change is pushed to Github.<br>
- It is also possible to use the manual deploy. Using the manual deploy is very useful if we want to see immediatly new elements we have just pushed to Github.<br>
- The site should show “App was successfully deployed” message and a button to view the deployed app. <br>
<br>
Deployment issue: during the first manual deployment of the app I experienced an issue related to the dependencies and the file requirements.txt. This was the issue displayed:
<image src="./assets/images/deployment-issue.png"><br>
VSCode is a local programme that is not already contained within a virtual environment (unlike Gitpod and Codeanywhere). Taking this into account, if we run the command pip3 freeze > requirements.txt, VSCode will install all packages on local (even what is not needed for the project). The issue could be solved by removing the added dependencies (since for this project I was not working with any) or set up a virtual environment for VSCode.<br>
